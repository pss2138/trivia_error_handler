# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Welcome to Trivia applicaiton! Here, we can explore diverse questions by users.
The main functions are:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
